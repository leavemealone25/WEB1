  <p>A love poem will not always be long and flowery.<br>
  Sometimes what you need to say can be very short.
  <br>In fact it may be the fact that the poem is short that makes it special.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;"><img src="dog&cat.jpg" width="100%"><br></br><br>Its short length may show that you put the time and effort in to make every word count.<br>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">You considered carefully every word choice.
  Every <strong>word</strong> choice has a reason behind it.<br>
  A short poem can be the ultimate act of romance when it is given the time and effort that it deserves.
